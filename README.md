# nand2tetris-wordle

Wordle implemented in JACK
by Jonathan Reyes and Phil Dreizen

## TODOs
- Handle backspace
- Wait for ENTER key to confirm word
- Tell player if they won or lost
- Let player pick language? Or compile different languages separately?
- Optimize dictionary size with compression?
- How do we pick words from the dictionary?
  + Enter a date?
  + Enter a number?
  + PRNG (seeded with what)?
